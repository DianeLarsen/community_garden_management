We began studying and applying permaculture principles to the garden including shifting our orchard plantings into food forests and using permaculture techniques such as hugelkultur and keyhole designs. We donate a small amount of the food we grow to the local food banks.",

SnoGrow is an initiative of churches of all denominations and garden Clubs in Snohomish who cooperate to grow produce for the food banks in the Community. The project at St. Michaels was funded by a grant from the Master Gardeners Association of Washington and the Archdiocese of Seattle with funds from the annual 'Rice Bowl' collection. The garden was also fortunate to have the fencing and arbor erected by Kevin Iverson as his Eagle Scout community project. We continue to receive modest grants from the Rice Bowl collection each year.",
